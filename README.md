# CollegePythonLearningProjects
Each python file is a script that I have created in conjunction with homework assignments from my professor. Since I am taking a CIT - Information Security Path, python seemed crucial to the pathway for automation and information Security uses.


HomeWork 1:
Temperature conversion. This first "Program" is meant to demonstrate my use of Decision tree's, basic arithmetic, and use of '''If/ELIF/ELSE''' in my program to prompt the user for a temperature value they want to convert.
I then prompt them at to Which value (Farenheit/Celsius) to convert to and to enter the choice as either C or F.

Upon that, I use '''IF/ELIF/ELSE''' to compare between the choices. So it'll look like this:
''' if tempChoice == "C":
      then TempVal = degF (Degrees in Farenheit)
      Convert degF to Celsius via arithmetic
      print degC 
    elif tempChoice == "F":
      then tempVal = degC (Degrees in Celsius)
      Convert DegC to Farenheit via arithmetic
    else
      print error

'''
